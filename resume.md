# Experience
## Technical Writer and Video Producer

As the sole technical writer at Sertifi, and only the second in its history, I built a [completely new support site](https://supportcenter.sertifi.com) in advance of the company launching a major renovation of its primary software products. In addition to writing support and technical documentation, I also wrote release notes and organized existing resources for greater usability by the development and customer success teams.

In my role as a video producer, I scripted, produced, and edited videos for use in support and marketing. I also recorded the voice-overs for many of these videos. [Watch them here](portfolio).
