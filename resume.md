# Experience
## Technical Writer and Video Producer
**Sertifi – Chicago, IL** \
March 2020 - Present

As the sole technical writer at Sertifi, and only the second in its history, I built a completely new support site in advance of the company launching a major renovation of its primary software products. In addition to writing support and technical documentation, I also wrote release notes and organized existing resources for greater usability by the development and customer success teams.

In my role as a video producer, I scripted, produced, and edited videos for use in support and marketing. I also recorded the voice-overs for many of these videos. [Watch them

## Technical Writer (Contract)
**CodeLathe – Austin, TX** \
August 2019 - December 2019

In my role as the main technical writer, I wrote product documentation and help guides for new product features in the company's main product, FileCloud. [An example of my work is here](https://www.filecloud.com/supportdocs/fcdoc/latest/online/filecloud-administrator-guide/governance-setup/smart-classification).

## UX Script Writer (Contract)
**Institute for Creative Integration – Austin, TX/San Jose, CA** \
March 2019 - October 2019

ICI was working on an autonomous vehicle agent (think something like HAL 9000 but more polite) for a major automotive manufacturer; I localized translated scripts to better reflect how an English speaker would talk to the vehicle, as well as guiding the vehicle's vocal responses.

## Writer & Editor (Contract)
**Liaison Creative - Austin, TX** \
May 2019 - August 2019

At Liasion, I wrote and edited articles on behalf of an educational professional's association.

## Content Specialist
**Wick Marketing - Austin,TX** \
August 2017 – January 2019

My duties as a Content Specialist focused on producing social media posts and video advertisements for clients in the construction industry.


## English Language Teaching Assistant
**Ministère de l’Éducation – Laon, France** \
September 2016 - May 2017

My time as a teacher was spent instructing middle-schoolers the basics of English, including grammar, common vocabulary, and just for fun, some slang words. The students always wanted me to teach them swear words, but I politely declined.
