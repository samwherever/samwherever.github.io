![REST API documentation](img/rest_api_docs.png)

With the [Readme](https://readme.com/) tool, I created a documentation site for Sertifi's REST API that let users run test calls against their own production environments, in addition to generating sample calls in various programming languages.

I also created sample recipes to demonstrate common API workflows.
